Users will first have to register themselves in order to take the survey.Basic details 
must include name, email, username, password and profile picture. Feel free to 
include other details if you feel that they are necessary. After doing so, he/she will 
have to log in. <br/>
 <br/>
There must be an admin account who will upload the questions for the surveys. 
He/she can modify/delete previous questions and view all the responses. The admin 
can also perform CRUD operations on the user profiles.<br/> 
 
A survey consists of multiple types of questions. A question can be of three types: <br/>
● MCQ with single answer 
● MCQ with multiple answers 
● Free text box for answer <br/>
 
After logging in, the user must have an option to:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
● Take survey created by the admin. <br/>
● View his previous survey’s answers.<br/> 
● Edit/Delete his/her profile<br/> 
 <br/>
There are two categories of surveys. One is active which the user hasn’t yet taken 
and the other is inactive which the user has already taken. You need to properly 
differentiate the types on the home screen (The screen which appears after the user 
is logged in). Once the user takes a survey, he/she cannot retake the survey unless 
there are changes made to it by the admin. The user needs to get notified of any 
changes (updation/deletion) in the questions of the previous surveys so that they can 
re­take the survey (You just have to move it from inactive to active). Also when a 
new survey is added, all the users should be notified about the new survey.
